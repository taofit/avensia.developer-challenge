    ```

1. Start servers

    ```bash

## Assignment

Your assignment is to create a **shopping cart** - an important component in every e-commerce solution that allows visitors to select items for purchase. 

The [API Server](https://github.com/avensia/api-sample-server) is a backend with endpoint for getting products & managing your cart, which we expect you to use. Please read [the documentation](https://github.com/avensia/api-sample-server).

We expect you to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) in your solution. In addition, you're encouraged to use TypeScript and CSS-in-JS which are both a part of our frontend tech stack. 

We also encourage you to explain your thoughts on technical decisions you make, either through a text document or through git commit messages.

You're free to focus on whatever aspect you wish. A visually beautiful solution can be just as impressive as a technically beautiful solution â€“ you decide which of your strengths you want to display.

## Requirements

These requirements are the basics of a shopping cart. If you have limited amount of time for this assignment, you can complete those that fit your time frame.

Required
* As a user I can **see the image & name of each item** in my shopping cart
* As a user I can **add an item** to my shopping cart
* As a user I can **remove an item** from my shopping cart
* As a user I can **see the total cost** of my shopping cart

Optional
* As a user I can **increment and decrement the quantity of an item** in my shopping cart

[See wireframe example](WIREFRAME.md). _You are not required to follow the wireframe. Its purpose is to clarify what it could be._

## Submitting

When you feel ready to submit your work: Push your commits and send us the link to your fork at Github (_No need for a pull request to our repository_). Then we'll book a time for a review with your contact at Avensia and one of our frontend developers.
