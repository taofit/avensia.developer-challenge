# Avensia Frontend Evaluation

The goal with this evaluation is to determine your skill level and strengths. This repository contains all the information you need to fulfill your assignment. Take your time and read through the whole document before you proceed.

This repository also contains a small boilerplate with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and a mocked REST API server to help you get started quickly.

## Parcel

The default setup uses [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as bundler. It supports:

* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* CSS
* SASS
* etc

## Mocked REST API server

Both scripts (`$ npm start` and `$ npm run serve`) starts the mocked REST API server. It simulates a real-life API with all endpoints you need for your assignment. For a more detailed description of the API you can head over to the [API section in Avensia API Sample Server-repo](https://github.com/avensia/api-sample-server#api).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

1.  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1.  Npm (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

### Setup

1.  **Install packages**

    With Npm:

    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

    With Yarn:

    ```bash
    $ yarn install
    ```

1.  **Start coding!** This will start Parcel at _localhost:8080_ and a mocked API server at _localhost:8181_.

    With Npm:

    ```bash
    $ npm start
    ```

    With Yarn:

    ```bash
    $ yarn start
    ```

## Assignment

**Your assignment is to create a shopping cart**. An important component in every e-commerce solution that allows visitors to select items for eventual purchase.

### Instructions

**You're free to focus on whatever aspect you wish**. A visually beautiful solution can be just as impressive as a technically beautiful solution â€“ you decide which of your strengths you want to display.

**Feel free to do what ever you want with your fork.** You're free to e.g. add dependencies, modify the build configuration, use another boilerplate of your choosing or even start from scratch. As long as you complete your assignment and your code is compiling.

Choose the stack you find suitable to make you shine. Avensia's stack contains React, Redux, TypeScript and CSS-in-JS. We encourage you to use that stack **if you're comfortable with it** and think they're useful for this assignment.

### Requirements

These requirements are the basics of a shopping cart. **It's to your advantage if you complete all of them.** However, if you have limited amount of time for this assignment, you are allowed to complete those that fit your time frame. Make sure that the requirements of your choice have been fulfilled to a good standard.

* As a user I can **read the title of each item** in my shopping cart
* As a user I can **see the image of each item** in my shopping cart
* As a user I can **increment and decrement the quantity of an item** in my shopping cart
* As a user I can **add an item** to my shopping cart
* As a user I can **remove an item** from my shopping cart
* As a user I can **see the total cost** of my shopping cart

[See wireframe example](WIREFRAME.md). _You are not required to follow the wireframe. Its purpose is to clarify what it could be._

### Submitting

When you feel ready to submit your work: Push your commits and send us the link to your fork at Github. Then we'll book a time for a review with your recruiter/contact at Avensia and one of our frontend developers.
