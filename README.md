# shopping cart challenge

In this repository you'll find our developer challenges for frontend and backend. You may select whichever you wish, or do them both if that is what you prefer.

If there is anything in the challenge that might not be part of your skill set, that's fine, just leave that part and focus on the other stuff. But please make sure to follow the instructions closely.

You'll find instructions for each challenge in the README file in the challenge's respective folder.

- [Frontend](/frontend)
- [Backend](/backend)
- [inRiver](/inriver)
 
When you're done please email us and let us know that you're ready!

Best of luck!
